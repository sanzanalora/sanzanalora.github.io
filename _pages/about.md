Welcome to my tiny corner of the web! I'm **Sanzana Karim *Lora***, a PhD student in Computer Science and Engineering at [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)](https://cse.buet.ac.bd/). I am currently privileged to be supervised by  [Prof. Dr. Rifat Shahriyar](https://cse.buet.ac.bd/faculty/faculty_detail/rifat). My research passions include, but are not limited to, Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning, and Computational Social Science. I'm dedicated to pioneering innovative, cost-effective solutions for low-resource natural languages, ensuring unheard voices find their platform.

Before this, I earned my M.Sc in Computer Science and Engineering from [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)](https://cse.buet.ac.bd/). I’m currently thrilled to serve as a Lecturer at [East West University (EWU)](https://ewubd.edu/).  I love sparking curiosity and sharing insights with the next generation of tech leaders.

Thank you for visiting my digital space! Dive into my projects and publications, and let’s connect to explore new ideas and collaborations!
